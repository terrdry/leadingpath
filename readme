addNumbers.sh
===========

Write a program that will iterate over the input, adding the digits, and returning the result.
 
Input:
- MUST accept STDIN as the default
- MUST accept a file when flag [-f] is specified
- MUST handle hex values when flag [-x] is specified
 
Output:
- MUST output result as Long to STDOUT
- MUST always output result in base 10
 
 
Be sure to include:
- README on how to build/test/execute your application
- Automated Unit Tests
 
 
Examples:
```
$ echo "abc123" | ./myProg
6
 
$ echo "abc123" | ./myProg -x
39
 
$ echo "qq"; | ./myProg
0
 
$ echo "abc123" > file.tmp
$ ./myProg -f file.tmp
6
```


Prerequisites
-------------

* Bash


Setup
-----
run in same directory or place in $PATH

Usage
-----

The requirements state the usage;

unit.sh is the script file that will test the bash script file "addNumbers.sh"

I didn't have enough time or I would have combined the two arrays when I loop through it.

As for the -x options; the example you gave didn't add up; perhaps you could explain it more and I can correct it later.

P.S. The unit test code expects that a file called "test" is there, I have included it in the repo;
"`addNumbers.sh -f test`" and it expects a 6 as a value
